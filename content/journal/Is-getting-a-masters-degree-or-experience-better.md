Two months ago, I wanted to get a master's degree because I thought researching and learning about computer science theory was very cool since it is the fundamental building block for everything we build. However, you're the one building the product the users use. So after some thinking, I came to the process for determining this.


1. List out the benefits of each.
2. List out what you can do with these benefits.
3. Does benefits and what you can do align with what you value, or is it something that you want to do every day and not get tired of it?


Master's Degree

* It makes you more qualified for more jobs
* You can do research and learn for a living
* You can discover the fundamentals theories and concepts
* A very rewarding process


Experience 

* You'll be more skilled in building great products
* You have more skills to build great products
* You can directly impact people with great products
* Build products in the process and enjoy the process, also


My goal

* Build a great product that I love and others will love too
* Start a tech start-up and do that for a living
* Have the freedom to solve problems that I choose
* Impact people's lives with tech

So, after all the thought, I found out that getting experience aligns with my goals much more. Although many things are pretty cool, and if I had all the time and energy, I would, it is what it is. My conclusion always goes back to your core values, and yeah, a lot of things seem cool and beneficial, but sometimes we need to filter out. A good reference or book for this would be "Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown."

Thanks for reading, and I hope you all have a very nice day!
