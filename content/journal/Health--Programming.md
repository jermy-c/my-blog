I’ve neglected my health for some time now. My love for programming and the Hustle culture has had me sitting in a seat and staring at a screen for most of my 16 wake hours of the day. It seemed like the right thing to do until every now and then; I felt burnt out. 

So recently, I’ve been browsing YouTube and found this guy named [Bryan Johnson](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co/). He was focusing on his health as his number priority, and at first, you might think he is rich already. Of course, he can focus so much effort on health. But that is the wrong perception since we need good health to be productive, and only by being productive will we be able to put food on the table. 

At the end of last year, I wrote down my new year’s resolution and incorporated some healthy habits, but it was hard to keep up with them. Especially when your motivation for programming is the greatest until you are burnt out. So recently bought a Fitbit Inspire 3 for $80US plus tax. And that was a hefty price for where I’m from, but it was worth it since it’s like a little companion and motivator for staying healthy. 

Sitting for long periods is great for programming and not for health. I’ve used a Pomodoro timer but sometimes forget to start the timer, thus sitting for too long, or I’m so in the zone that I ignore it. But the Fitbit is different. You just wear it and forget about it until it reminds you. The cool thing is in the app; there’s the motivation for mindfulness, exercise, and sleep, which are three very important things. 

I personally think programming is a marathon and not a sprint. You need to do things that will keep you productive at a steady, sustained pace rather than an outpace, which is why I’m writing this. I hope you’re in optimal health, and thanks for reading.
